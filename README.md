Here’s a reorganized plan for a **basketball tactics training game focused on a phone app**. It emphasizes intuitive touch controls, clear guidance, and real-time feedback, while ensuring the app is light and practical for team use.

## **Basketball Tactics Training App (Mobile-Centric Design)**  

### **1. Core Features**  
#### **1.1 Tactical Simulation**
- **Pre-set Tactics**: 
  - Includes common basketball plays (e.g., pick-and-roll, fast breaks).  
  - Accessible from a library, categorized by difficulty or style.  

- **Custom Tactics**:  
  - Drag-and-drop interface for coaches to design new plays.  
  - Specify player roles, positions, and movement paths on a **virtual court**.  

- **Tactic Playback**:  
  - Coaches can simulate the designed play as an animation for players to visualize.  
  - Players can practice with guided or unguided execution modes.  

#### **1.2 Training Modes**
1. **Single-Player Training**  
   - Players control one role in the play and follow instructions to complete tasks.  
   - Example: “Run to the left corner,” “Set a screen,” or “Pass to player #3.”  
   - Instant feedback provided for accuracy, timing, and decision-making.  

2. **Team Training (Real-Time Multiplayer)**  
   - Multiple players join the same session, each controlling a specific role.  
   - Real-time collaboration to execute tactics as planned.  
   - **AI Players**: Fill in for missing team members to ensure full-team simulation.  

3. **Challenge Mode**  
   - Play without guidance (e.g., no drawn paths) to simulate real-game decision-making.  
   - Measure performance with scoring (e.g., successful passes, positioning).  

---

### **2. Controls and Interaction**  
#### **2.1 Touch Controls**  
1. **Player Movement**  
   - Drag the player icon (or a virtual joystick) to move to the desired position.  
   - Path guidance (dotted lines) for beginners, with dynamic color changes:  
     - Green for correct movements, red for errors.  

2. **Actions (Pass, Shoot, Screen)**  
   - **Pass**: Tap on a teammate or drag a pass line to the target.  
   - **Shoot**: Long press the player icon to aim and release to shoot.  
   - **Screen**: Double-tap on the intended screen location or teammate.  

3. **Auto Snap**  
   - Players automatically "snap" into correct positions when close enough to the target area to reduce precision frustration.  

#### **2.2 Feedback Mechanisms**  
- **Vibration Feedback**: Short buzz for correct actions, longer buzz for errors.  
- **Visual Cues**:  
  - Correct actions show green highlights.  
  - Errors display red outlines or a brief pop-up warning.

### **3. Tactical Guidance**  
1. **Dynamic Guidance (Training Mode)**  
   - Display player-specific paths using dotted lines or arrows.  
   - Highlight key areas (e.g., "screen zone" or "pass target") with color-coded circles.  

2. **Unguided Execution (Challenge Mode)**  
   - No visual aids; players rely on memory and understanding of the play.  

3. **Coach Mode**  
   - Coaches can monitor in real-time and provide instant feedback via text or voice chat.  

---

### **4. Real-Time Multiplayer (Team Mode)**  
- **Session Management**:  
  - One player or coach hosts the session, and others join using a room code.  

- **Voice Communication**:  
  - Integrated voice chat to simulate live game communication.  

- **Roles and Collaboration**:  
  - Each player is assigned a position and role (e.g., Point Guard, Forward).  
  - Team members must communicate to adjust plays dynamically.  

---

### **5. Post-Training Analysis**  
1. **Performance Metrics**  
   - Positioning accuracy.  
   - Execution timing (e.g., how long it took to reach a spot or pass the ball).  
   - Completion rate of tactics.  

2. **Replay Functionality**  
   - Watch replays of training sessions with visual markers for errors and successes.  

3. **Leaderboard**  
   - Track individual and team performance to encourage improvement and friendly competition.  

---

### **6. Visual and UI Design**  
#### **6.1 Simplified Visuals**  
- **2D Court View**:  
  - Top-down perspective resembling a tactical whiteboard.  
  - Players represented by colored circles with numbers or initials.  

- **Minimal Animation**:  
  - Focus on clarity rather than realism.  
  - Smooth movement animations for players and the ball.  

#### **6.2 User Interface**  
- Large, easy-to-tap buttons for mobile use.  
- Minimal text on the main screen; rely on icons and tooltips.  
- Accessible menus for tactics library, training modes, and session management.  

---

### **7. Technical Implementation**  
#### **7.1 Development Tools**  
- **Unity**: Excellent for mobile game development, cross-platform support.  
- **Firebase**: For real-time multiplayer and data storage.  
- **Photon Engine**: Handles low-latency multiplayer communication.  

#### **7.2 Device Compatibility**  
- Optimize for mid-range smartphones to reach a broader audience.  
- Ensure low battery consumption and small app size (<200 MB).  

---

### **8. Engagement and Retention Features**  
1. **Daily Challenges**  
   - Example: “Complete 3 pick-and-roll plays with 95% accuracy.”  

2. **Customization**  
   - Allow players to personalize their icons or colors.  

3. **Coach Sharing**  
   - Coaches can save and share custom tactics with other teams.
