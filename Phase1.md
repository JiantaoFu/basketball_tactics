ok, I have phase 1 plan, you already have the fullcourt setup, so you can add a button to change it to half court i think. More detail below, ask me if you need any more info.

For **Phase 1**, we’ll build the simplest version of the app to focus on its foundational functionality. This will allow you to test the concept quickly and provide a baseline to expand upon in future phases.

## **Phase 1 Plan: Basketball Tactics Training App**  

### **Objective**  
Create a functional prototype that:  
1. Displays a basketball court.  
2. Allows basic player movement.  
3. Demonstrates a single pre-set tactic with guidance.  
4. Provides basic feedback on execution.

### **Features for Phase 1**  

#### **1. Display a Basketball Court**  
- **Half-Court View**:  
  - A simple top-down 2D basketball court with key zones (e.g., free-throw line, three-point arc).  
  - Basic court markings, no fancy textures or animations.  

#### **2. Player Movement**  
- Players represented by **circles** labeled with numbers (#1, #2, etc.).  
- Drag-and-drop functionality to move players.  
  - Players snap into designated positions when close enough.  

#### **3. Single Pre-Set Tactic**  
- Implement one basic play, such as a **pick-and-roll**:  
  1. Player #1 moves to the top of the key.  
  2. Player #2 sets a screen.  
  3. Player #1 dribbles around the screen to a designated shooting zone.  
- **Guidance**:  
  - Use dotted lines to show the movement path.  
  - Highlight target zones (e.g., circles on the court) for each step.  

#### **4. Feedback System**  
- Real-time visual feedback:  
  - **Green Highlight**: When a player reaches the correct position.  
  - **Red Highlight**: When the player deviates from the path.  

- **Session Completion Summary**:  
  - A basic score (e.g., "3/4 steps completed correctly").  

#### **5. Simple UI**  
- Buttons:  
  - **Start Play**: Begin the pre-set tactic.  
  - **Reset**: Reset player positions to their starting spots.

### **Phase 1 Technical Details**  

#### **Development Stack**  
- **Framework**: Unity for cross-platform support.  
- **Language**: C# for logic and interactions.  

#### **Assets**  
- Use free or basic basketball court and player icon assets from Unity Asset Store.  

#### **Device Compatibility**  
- Focus on Android for initial testing, with minimal performance requirements.

### **Development Roadmap for Phase 1**  

1. **Week 1: Setup and UI Basics**  
   - Create the 2D basketball court.  
   - Add draggable player icons with labels.  
   - Implement basic UI buttons (start/reset).  

2. **Week 2: Movement and Guidance**  
   - Implement drag-and-drop movement for players.  
   - Add snapping logic for designated positions.  
   - Display movement paths with dotted lines for the pre-set tactic.  

3. **Week 3: Feedback System**  
   - Highlight correct/incorrect positions in real-time.  
   - Display a simple completion score at the end of the session.  

4. **Week 4: Testing and Iteration**  
   - Test with your team to ensure the movement, guidance, and feedback are intuitive.  
   - Fix bugs and refine interactions based on feedback.

### **Deliverable for Phase 1**  
- A fully functional app prototype with:  
  - A simple court.  
  - Player movement.  
  - One guided tactic.  
  - Basic feedback system.

Once this is ready, you’ll have a working prototype to gather feedback and plan for Phase 2 (e.g., adding more tactics, multiplayer, or advanced training modes). Let me know if you need help with design or development specifics!
