## **Basketball Tactics Training App (MVP Plan)**  

### **Core Features for MVP**  

#### **1. Tactical Simulation (Basic Functionality)**  
1. **Pre-set Tactics**:  
   - Include a small library of 3-5 pre-designed plays (e.g., pick-and-roll, basic zone defense).  
   - Plays are animated step-by-step for players to observe and practice.  

2. **Interactive Player Control**:  
   - Players can drag and move their assigned player icons to correct positions on the court.  
   - Feedback when a player reaches the correct position (e.g., icon highlights green).  

---

#### **2. Single-Player Training Mode**  
- **Objective**: Train individual roles in a play.  
- **How It Works**:  
  1. Select a tactic from the library.  
  2. The app guides the user step-by-step (e.g., “Move to the corner,” “Pass to player #4”).  
  3. Provide visual guidance (e.g., dotted lines) and basic feedback (success/fail).  

---

#### **3. Simple Touch Controls**  
- **Player Movement**: Drag-and-drop the player icon to move.  
- **Pass Action**: Tap on a teammate to simulate a pass.  
- **No advanced actions (e.g., shooting, screens)** for the MVP to keep it simple.  

---

#### **4. Visual and UI Design**  
1. **Simplified 2D Court**:  
   - Top-down view with a half-court or full-court display.  
   - Players represented as circles labeled with numbers (e.g., #1, #2).  

2. **Minimal UI**:  
   - Play selection, start, and reset buttons.  
   - Step-by-step instructions displayed at the top or bottom of the screen.  

---

#### **5. Basic Feedback System**  
- **Real-Time Feedback**:  
  - Correct actions are highlighted in green (e.g., when a player reaches a position).  
  - Incorrect actions show a red warning.  

- **End-of-Session Summary**:  
  - Success rate (e.g., “You completed 4/5 steps correctly”).  

---

#### **6. Lightweight Multiplayer**  
- **Team Mode (Optional for MVP)**:  
  - Support for 2-3 players in the same session.  
  - Each player controls one assigned role in a tactic.  
  - Simple room creation and joining with a code.  

---

### **Technical Stack for MVP**  
1. **Development Tools**:  
   - **Unity**: Simplifies cross-platform development for Android and iOS.  
   - **Firebase**: Handles cloud data storage for tactics and basic real-time multiplayer.  

2. **Device Compatibility**:  
   - Focus on mid-range smartphones.  
   - Optimize for fast loading and smooth performance.

### **MVP Development Roadmap**  

1. **Week 1-2: Court and Player Basics**  
   - Implement the 2D court with draggable player icons.  
   - Add functionality for assigning player positions.  

2. **Week 3-4: Pre-Set Tactics and Guidance**  
   - Build a small library of 3-5 basic tactics.  
   - Add guided paths (dotted lines) for player movements.  

3. **Week 5-6: Feedback System**  
   - Implement real-time visual feedback (correct/incorrect actions).  
   - Create basic success metrics for training sessions.  

4. **Week 7-8: Single-Player Training Mode**  
   - Combine pre-set tactics, guidance, and feedback into a cohesive training session.  

5. **Week 9-10: Lightweight Multiplayer (Optional)**  
   - Add room creation and real-time collaboration for 2-3 players.  

---

### **Testing and Launch**  
- **Testing**: Use the app with your basketball team to gather feedback.  
- **Iterate**: Focus on improving controls, UI clarity, and feedback based on user input.  
- **Launch**: Release the MVP to app stores or distribute directly to your team.
